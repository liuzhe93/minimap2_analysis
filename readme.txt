Two types of ways:
1. The first is single-molecule real-time fluorescence sequencing and the representative technology in Pacific Bioscience's SMRT technology.

Deoxynucleotides are labeled with fluorescence, and the microscope can record the intensity of fluorescence in real-time; when fluorescently labeled deoxynucleotides are incorporated into the DNA strand, its fluorescence is detected on the DNA strand at the same time; when it is combined with the DNA strand When a chemical bond is formed, its fluorescent group is cleaved by DNA polymerase, and the fluorescence disappears. This fluorescently labeled deoxynucleic acid will not affect the activity of DNA polymerase. After the fluorescence is cut off, the synthetic DNA strand is the same as the natural DNA strand.

2. The second is nanopore sequencing. 

The representative company is Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). The novel nanopore sequencing method uses electrophoresis technology to drive individual molecules through nanopores one by one through electrophoresis; the diameter of nanopores is minimal, allowing only single nucleotide polymers to pass through, while ATCG single alkali The charged properties of the bases are different, and the type of bases given can be detected by the difference of the electrical signal, to achieve sequencing.

It can read methylated cytosine directly, and there is no need to perform bisulfite processing on the genome like second-generation sequencing (how to understand: that is, if you use third-generation sequencing to do a whole-genome sequencing, you can also have DNA methylation data analysis)
